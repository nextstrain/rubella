## Scope of this dataset

This dataset assigns clades to rubella virus samples based on strain
and genotype information from FIXME WHO REFERENCES HERE

FIXME These two papers, collectively, define 7 distinct yellow fever virus
genotypes based on a 670 nucleotide region of the yellow fever virus
genome, (bases 641-1310), called the prM-E region. This region
comprises the 3' end of the pre-membrane protein (prM) gene, the
entire membrane protein (M) gene, and the 5' end of the envelope
protein (E) gene.

This dataset can be used to assign genotypes to any sequence that
includes at least 500 bp of the E1 region, including whole genome
sequences. Sequence data beyond the E1 region will be reported as an
insertion in the Nextclade output.

## Features

This dataset supports:

- Assignment of genotypes
- Phylogenetic placement
- Sequence quality control (QC)
